A)
State space: Litres in jugs $([0; 3], [0; 5])$
Start state: $(0, 0)$
Actions:
- Fill jug 1
- Fill jug 2
- Empty jug 1
- Empty jug 2
- Pour jug 1 into 2
- Pour jug 2 into 1
Action Function (cost function): $A(c)=1$
Goal test: Jug 2 contains exactly 4 litres

B)
State space: The number of cannibals and missionaries on either side, and where the boat is. Doesn't contain tuples where missionaries are outnumbered.
- $(NoOfCannibals, NoOfMissionaries, Boat)$
Start state: $(3,3,1)$
Actions: 
- Row 1 or 2 persons to other side
	- Formally this is split in more cases, but eh
Action Function (cost function): $A(c)=1$
Goal test: $(0, 0, 0)$

Our heuristic is a lower bound indicating at least 3 states
![[Pasted image 20241014101640.png]]
Uniform cost, as calculating the heuristic requires running bfs first on the node

## Ex 3
![[Pasted image 20241014101655.png]]
1. Is consistent (and thus admissible), as any action has cost 1, and reduces the number of dirty spots by a maximum of 1
2. Not admissible. With 8 clean spots the actual remaining cost might just be 1
3. Not admissible, sum is too large. 2 dirty spots may sum to a cost of 3, but be cleanable in 2 actions if adjacent
4. Not admissible, always 9
5. Admissible, as it works as a lower bound for the work needed

## Ex 4

![[Pasted image 20241014101724.png]]
1. State: $(s\in\{S, X_{1}, \dots, X_{5}\},hasA,hasB,hasC)$
	- This assumes we always use optimal path between points
	Actions:
	- Move to a new $s$ in the above set
2. Heuristic: Manhatten-distance to S
3. Tiebreaker is maximising amount of symbols, and then number of x

b)
- Number of elements in first array times 10 minutes
- It is consistent
c)
It affects ordering but shouldn't affect the length of the final presentation, since we are still trying all minimal combinations. 
## Ex 7

1)
State space: $A^{*}\times (M\cup\epsilon) \times D^{*}$
- (Ignore internal ordering in A and D)
Start stace: $(\epsilon, \epsilon, \epsilon)$
Actions:
- Add Appetizer
- Choose Main dish
- add dessert
Action / cost function: Cost of dish
Goal test: $(A^{+}\times M\times D^{+})$ where each guest likes at least 1 thing

2)
Heuristic
- Guests missing something they like, times the cheapest item that guest likes

3)
We didn't draw it, and neither did the solution
