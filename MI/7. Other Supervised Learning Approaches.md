2. We estimate using the conditional probabilities:
	- $P(MH=1a|BH=op)=\frac{2}{8}$
	- $P(MH=1a|BH=me)=\frac{1}{7}$
	- $P(MH=1a|BH=draw)=\frac{0}{5}$
	- $P(FC=1|BH=op)=\frac{2}{8}$
	- $P(FC=1|BH=me)=\frac{3}{7}$
	- $P(FC=1|BH=draw)=\frac{3}{5}$
	- $P(SC=1|BH=op)=\frac{4}{8}$
	- $P(SC=1|BH=me)=\frac{2}{7}$
	- $P(SC=1|BH=draw)=\frac{4}{5}$
3. Math
	- $P(BH=op|X)=\alpha\frac{2}{8}\cdot\frac{2}{8}\cdot\frac{4}{8}=0.03125\alpha=0.64115$
	- $P(BH=me|X)=\alpha\frac{1}{7}\cdot\frac{3}{7}\cdot\frac{2}{7}=0.01749\alpha=0.35884$
	- $P(BH=draw|X)=\alpha\frac{0}{5}\cdot\frac{3}{5}\cdot\frac{4}{5}=0\alpha=0$
	- $\alpha=\frac{1}{0.03125+0.01749}\approx20.51702$
	- So our prediction is $BH=op$

1. We calculate the distance to each point:

| Example | Distance  |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1       | $0+1+1=2$ |
| 2       | $0+1+1=2$ |
| 3       | $1+0+0=1$ |
| 4       | $2+1+1=4$ |
| 5       | $2+0+1=3$ |
So for 1-nearest neighbor the closest example is example 3, so the classification is no.
2. The 3 closest neighbors are 1, 2 and 3, so the classification is yes.
3. Doubling all the values in the income matrix and making the distance between unmarried and divorced 0 would make the result "yes".

- Precision: $\frac{TP}{Predicted Yes}=\frac{8}{16+8}\approx0.333$
- Recall: $\frac{TP}{ActualYes}=\frac{8}{10}=0.8$
- Specificity: $\frac{TP}{ActualNo}=\frac{8}{16+974}\approx0.008$
- Accuracy: $\frac{TP+TN}{m}=\frac{8+974}{1000}=0.982$
Specificity and recall are swapped.
Precision becomes (in the old terms): $\frac{TN}{PredictedNo}=\frac{974}{976}\approx0.998$

The accuracy on the unchanged tree is $\frac{3}{5}$.
The accuracy of the tree after replacing the "Nature" node with a "Yes" leaf node is $\frac{4}{5}$
Removing the "Fly" node turns it into a "Yes" leaf, from which the parent node can be simplified into a "yes" leaf as both its children are "yes". For this, the accuracy falls to $\frac{3}{5}$, so we don't make this change.
Removing the left-most "fly" node and replacing it with "yes" results in an accuracy of $\frac{4}{5}$ on the validation set, replacing it with a "no" results in an accuracy of $\frac{3}{5}$, so we place a "yes" node, as that results in a simpler tree.
We cannot prune any more nodes so we are done.

The model in figure 1 is simpler as it only requires a single parameter. We therefore prefer it according to Ockham's razor.
