## Ex 2
For each of the following assertions, say whether it is true or false and give a short explanation in 1 or 2 sentences for each of your answers.

1. An agent that senses only partial information about the state cannot be perfectly rational.
	1. Yes it can, rationality is a meassure relative to available information
2. There exist task environments in which no pure reflex agent can behave rationally.
	1. No idea, it feels wrong to say no, but we have no example
	2. Vi har brug for øl
3. There exists a task environment in which every agent is rational.
	1. Sure, play 2 chess robots against each other
	2. Or not i guess
4. The input to an agent program is the same as the input to the agent function.
	1. Maybe who knows
5. It is possible for a given agent to be perfectly rational in two distinct task environments
	1. Yep, if it can solve 2 tasks perfectly rationally
6. Every agent is rational in an unobservable environment.
	1. Technically yes, as any information would mean partial observability
7. A perfectly rational poker-playing agent never loses.
	1. It gets unlucky, but probably wins in the long run
8. Suppose an agent selects its next action uniformly at random from a set of possible actions. There exists a deterministic task environment in which this agent is rational
	1. Yes, any task environment in which any action is equal

## Ex 3
1. What is the state space the agent needs to reason with?
	1. For each square, is it either empty, owned, or enemy controlled
2.  How many states are there in the state space?
	1. $9^3$ except less than that
3.  Design 2 different feature-based representations of this state space.
	1. For each square, is it either empty, owned, or enemy controlled
	2. Player owns ((0,0), (0,1), (0,2), ...)
4.  Design one relational representation of this state space.
	1. $owned(tile, p1)$

## Ex 4
1. Compared to the tic-tac-toe problem, is there a single “right” state space?
2. 
	1. Nope, state is continuous
	2. No definitively best representation
3. Design one possible feature-based hierarchical state representation for the robot.
	1. Game has players, fields, and ball
	2. Players have direction, velocity, goal
	3. field has stuff...
	4. ball also has
