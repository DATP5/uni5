- Choosing one of the cluster centers as the outlier and one of the points on the inner edge of the two clusters
- A point around the center of each cluster

- K-means:
	- Determine the distances:
		- (2,4) - b
		- (2, 6) - a
		- (3, 7) - a
		- (3, 5) - b
		- (5, 4) - b
		- (6, 5) - b
		- (6,7) - b
	- Calculate new centroids:
		- (2.5,6.5) - a
		- (4.4,5) - b
	- Determine the distances:
		- (2,4) - b
		- (2,6) - a
		- (3,7) - a
		- (3,5) - b
		- (5,4) - b
		- (6,5) - b
		- (6,7) - b
	- Calculate centroids:
		- Categories are the same, so centroids do not change. yay!
- Sum squared errors:
	- a: $0+2 = 2$
	- b: 29 (python trust me)
	- a (new): 0.5 + 0.5 = 1
	- b (new): 19.1

1. $d_3$ is closest
	-  ![[Pasted image 20241007105357.png]]
	- Where da is distance squared from $d_2$
2. We calculate mean and $\sigma$:
	-  Mean: (60.8, 6.8)
	- $\sigma$: (29.98, 3.66)

| Point | Coord          |
| ----- | -------------- |
| $d_1$ | (-1.79, -1.31) |
| $d_2$ | (-0.29, -1.04) |
| $d_3$ | (0.31, 0.88)   |
| $d_4$ | (0.81, 1.15)   |
| $d_5$ | (0.97, 0.33)   |

$d_1$ is now closest

4. $d_1$ is a quite significant outlier. So it should be removed or put in it's own cluster. Z-normalization can also be used if it is relevant to the dataset.

1. When the SSE stops falling significantly, a sufficient number of clusters has likely been found.
