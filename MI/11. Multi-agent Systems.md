The right one to get 7
![[Pasted image 20241111101315.png]]
- An optimally playing opponent chooses to go left after, giving max 7
- A non-optimal opponent is dumb, so idk. Potentially 10 given max plays optimally, but 8 if min is not stoopid. Or 7 if strategy is the same as above.

1. No, you could win with 1, 2, 3 or more points, which would be different outcomes
2. No, it assumes the opponent plays optimally. Knowing the opponents moves, another strategy might be better, it simply minimises risk
3. True, if considering the game as a mixed strategy. Every finite game has one, according to slide 48
4. Games with pure strategies do not necessarily have an equilibrium, again, rock, paper, scissor
5. True, as with 3. all finite games have equilibriums. An infinite non-zero-sum game may not.

- $(b3, a1)$, $(b6,a2)$, $(b1,a3)$
- given $b4$, if Andy plays $a2$ or $a3$ he can improve by choosing $a1$, thus those are not equilibrium. If he  plays $a1$, Barb improves by playing $b3$, thus this is not an equilibrium either. 
Trying case for $p_{b_{4}}=1$ and $p_{a_{x}}=\frac{1}{3}$
- Andy
	- Expected utility:
		- $1(\frac{1}{3}*2+ \frac{1}{3}*0 + \frac{1}{3}*0)= \frac{2}{3}$
Trying case for $pb_{4}=1$ and unknown $pa_{1}, pa_{2}, pa_{3}$
- Andy
	- Expected utility
		- $1(pa_{1}*2+ pa_{2}*0 + pa_{3}*0)= 2pa_{1}$
IDK, look at the solution?

For mixed strategy, if andy's move contains a part of a1, barb moves b3 to improve her strategy. If a1 is not part of andy's move, andy can move more a1 to improve his strategy.
