a)
443 free memory pages gives 11 iterations to read all inner blocks
I/O cost: $4500+(11\cdot1500)=21.000$

b)
$\lceil1500/443\rceil=4$
I/O cost: $1500+(4\cdot4500)=19.500$

c)
I/O cost: $4500+(11\cdot200)=7600$

a)
hash:

Index nested loop:
![[Pasted image 20241025141757.png]]

Hashing is practically building an index, which already exists for indexed nested loop, so that is more convenient

Since all of T fits in memory it can all be hashed at once, which has an I/O price of 200. Then since T is in memory, we can read S and hash while reading, at a cost of 4500 I/O
- Total is 4700 I/O
Index nested loop is just the formula, so $200+(200\cdot250\cdot0.25)=12.700$ 

b)
Sort-merge
![[Pasted image 20241025142345.png]]
We do not have a sorting term for S as it is clustered and thus sorted

$2\cdot200\cdot(1+\log(200/443))+200+4500\approx5048$

Sortmerge good
## Ex 3.1

Order doesn't matter for final size

Joining $r_{1}$ with $r_{2}$ results in at most $|r_{1}|=1000$ tuples, as C is a primary key in r2, so each entry in r1 joins with at most one in r2. Same principle then exists for the join with r3, since the intermediate result has at most 1000 tuples with keys E, which each join with at most 1 tuple in r3.
- The final size estimate is 1000 tuples

## Ex 3.2
![[Pasted image 20241025140740.png]]
- Assuming uniform distribution, and, according to the inclusion principle assume that each value for C in r1 also exists in r2, we take the cartesian product multiplied by the probability that the Cs are equal $(\frac{1}{1100})$, giving $\frac{1000\cdot1500}{1100}=1363$ 
- No common attributes, so we assume 0. The solution however assumes that given no common keys we take the cartesian product, for $1000\cdot750=750.000$ tuples
- Following the above logic from the first estimate, we get $\frac{1500\cdot750}{100}=11.250$ tuples
- 4
	- Strategy: $(r_{1}\bowtie r_{2})\bowtie r_{3}$ since r1xr2 gives the smallest intermediary result
	- Size: Same as estimate 3, but with the intermediate table instead of $r_{2}$ giving $\frac{1363\cdot750}{100}=10.227$
- Then the intermediate table has 1500 tuples, since all of r2's tuples join with exactly 1 from r1. We then repeat the previous calculation with this new size: $\frac{1500\cdot750}{100}=11250$
