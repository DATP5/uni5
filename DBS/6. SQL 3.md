# PLACES THAT SAYS `JOIN` WITHOUT CONDITIONS SHOULD BE `NATURAL JOIN`

```sql
SELECT S.sid, S.lastname
FROM student S
WHERE 2 <= (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(SG.weekday))
	  FROM studygroup SG JOIN member JOIN student
	  WHERE sid = S.sid)
```

![[Pasted image 20241004131241.png]]
```sql
WITH tutorscount AS (
	SELECT tid, COUNT(DISTINCT(sid)) as studentcount
	FROM tutor JOIN studygroup JOIN member
	GROUP BY tid
)

SELECT t.tid
FROM tutor t JOIN tutorscount tc
WHERE tc.studentcount >= (SELECT MAX studentcount FROM tutorscount)
```

```sql
SELECT e.eid, AVG(h.achievedpoints)
FROM exercisesheet e LEFT JOIN handsin h
GROUP BY e.eid
```
![[Pasted image 20241004131328.png]]
```sql
	SELECT sid, COUNT(DISTINCT(eid)) as gradeCount
	FROM students JOIN handsin
	WHERE achievedpoints BETWEEN 1 AND 5 -- BETWEEN is inclusive
	GROUP BY sid HAVING gradeCount >= 3
```


![[Pasted image 20241004131335.png]]
```sql
SELECT s.sid, lastname, eid
FROM student s JOIN handin h JOIN exercisesheet e
WHERE h.achievedpoints = e.maxpoints
```


## Ex 2

For this, see slide 45. It is identical
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE closure(currentpart, subpart) AS (
	SELECT partID, subpartID
	FROM subpart
UNION
	SELECT c.currentpart, DISTINCT sp.partID
	FROM subpart sp, closure c
	WHERE sp.subpartID = c.currentPart
)

SELECT DISTINCT p.name
FROM closure c JOIN part p ON c.currentpart = p.partID
WHERE p.name = 'P-100'
```

The above shit is dumb and complicated. Here is the answer:
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE totalPart ( partid ) AS (
    SELECT subpartID
    FROM subpart
    WHERE partID = 'P-100'
UNION
    SELECT DISTINCT s . subpartid
    FROM totalPart t , subpart s
    WHERE t . partid = s . partid
)

SELECT p . name
FROM totalPart t , part p
WHERE t . partID = p . partID ;
```

Or even better
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE totalPart ( partid ) AS (
    VALUES ( 'P -100' )
UNION
    SELECT DISTINCT s . subpartid
    FROM totalPart t , subpart s
    WHERE t . partid = s . partid
)
SELECT p . name
FROM totalPart t , part p
WHERE t . partID = p . partID ;
```

1. Materialised views are pre-computed and updated each time a constituent table is updated. Dynamic views by default compute the view as a query each time it is used, and is only a layer of abstraction
2. 
```sql
CREATE VIEW admittedstudents AS 
	SELECT sid AS studentID, SUM(achievedpoints) / (SELECT SUM(maxpoints) FROM exercisesheet) AS achievedPercentage
	FROM handin
	GROUP BY sid HAVING achievedPercentage >= 0.5

```
## Ex 4

1. 0 = null is weird, use IS
2. HAVING before GROUP BY
3. Not grouping on lastname
4. wtf is w? Never defined
