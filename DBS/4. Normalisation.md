## Ex 1

a)
- AD
b)
- Nope, so we decompose
![[Pasted image 20240923143725.png]]
1. AD
2. $D\rightarrow B$
3. $D^{+}\rightarrow BCD$
4. $(AD), (BCD)$
5. We repeat
0. AD is good, since only 2 attributes
1. D
2. $B\rightarrow C$
3. $B^{+}\rightarrow C$
4. $(DB), (BC)$
5. We good
$(AD, DB, BC)$


## Ex 2
![[Pasted image 20240923123831.png]]
The two possible non-trivial FDs are:
A->B
B->A

If neither exist, it is trivially BCNF
If only one exist, that also means LHS is superkey, and it is BCNF
If both exist, two superkeys exist, one for each, so it is also BCNF

## Ex 3
![[Pasted image 20240923123851.png]]
a)
- $HS^{+}\rightarrow HSRCTG$
H cannot be produced from any rules, and neither can S. Having those alone is enough, and so no other keys exist

b)
- They all have single attribute RHS
- We have been unable to produce any FDs from the rest
- We have been unable to find any redundant LHS attributes
c)
![[Pasted image 20240923150015.png]]
1. Done
2. Done
3. $R_{1}(C,T), R_{2}(H,R,C), R_{3}(H,T,R), R_{4}(H,S,R), R_{5}(C,S,G)$
4. $R_{4}$ contains a key
5. We think we are happy :)

## Ex 4
![[Pasted image 20240923123904.png]]
a)
1. Done
2. Y->X and Y->Z combine to Y->XZ
3. $R_{1}(Z,W), R_{2}(Y,X,Z), R_{3}(X,W,Y)$
4. XW is a key contained in $R_{3}$
	1. Y is also a key alone
5. We think we are happy
b)
- We were unable to derive any FDs which showed a violation of BCNF
- Better answer is that all LHS are superkeys in some $R_{x}$


## Ex 5

![[Pasted image 20240923123928.png]]
a)
Lossless:
- Intersection is A
- A->BC derives $R_{1}$ so it is lossless
Dependency preserving:
- Dependencies in the new tables:
	- A->BC
	- E->A
- From these, B->D cannot be derived
- It is not dependency-preserving

b)
Lossless:
- Intersection is CD
- CD->E derives $R_{4}$, so it is lossless
Dependency preserving
- E->A is not directly preserved in a table
- It can also not be derived, as nothing produces A
***Answer says it is preserving***
- Using E->A, E->CD can be derived. Then if E->A is removed after that, it can still be derived, but that answer seems weird, considering it relies on the previous use of E->A

a)
No, slide 35 is a direct counterproof of this
