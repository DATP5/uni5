a)
- StudentID -> student.name, office, officePhone, email
- officePhone -> office
- courseID -> course.name, desc, location
- name -> description

b)
- StudentID -> courseID
	- StudentID -> course.name, desc, location
There's primary keys on everything so we know everything

a)
Our FDs:
- Zip -> City, state
- Street, city, state -> Zip
From this we can infer the following:
- Zip, street -> City, state, street
	- Zip, street -> City, state, street (Augmentation)
	- City, state, street -> Zip, street (Augmentation)
	- City, state, street -> Zip, street + Zip, street -> City, state, street => Zip, street -> City, state, street (Transitivity)

b)
Zip, street
Street, city, state

a)
1. AC->BC (Augmentation)
2. BC->B (Reflexivity)
3. AC->B (Transitivity on 1. and 2.)
b)

| A   | B   | C   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | x   | 2   |
| 2   | x   | 3   |
Here, A can be used to find C, which is also trivially possible with AB, but B itself does not identify C.
