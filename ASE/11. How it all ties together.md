# 01 Introduction to agile

1. What are the main differences between plan-driven and agile processes?  
    Plandriven assumes everything can be known initially, while agile embraces adaptability
    
1. Reflect on what your project would look like if you applied a plan-driven process vs. an agile process.
If we started plan-driven we would not get anything done. At. All. We were some what agile, but without the structure of scrum
- Disorder
    1. How would the approach have shaped your project, and why did your group choose the process you did?
        See above, but also, we didn't actively choose, because all known approaches requires knowing what you will be doing in 2 days. Possibly kanban. We made a board, but that's it

# 02 Agile Values, Cynefin and Scrum  
  
  ![[Pasted image 20241129124253.png]]

1. Explain the Scrum process and the different building blocks it consists of.
    1. Roles
        - Product Owner - People person
        - Scrum Master
        - Developer
    2. Artefacts
	    - Product Backlog
	    - Scrum Backlog
	    - Increments
    3. Events
	    - Sprint Planning
	    - Sprint
	    - Sprint Retrospective - How did we work and why are we dumb?
	    - Sprint Review - What we did, please please please include customer
	    - Daily Scrum - Not a status meeting, just impediments and coordination 

2. Reflect how you have utilized Scrum in your semester project. Maybe you have been inspired by specific events to guide your group work, found certain artefacts helpful during your project, or worked according to Scrum principles?
	- If you have not, reflect on how you could have applied it.  
		- Kanban, it is not scrum, but that aspect. Having a product backlog to pull in exercises from, and a scrum backlog to see what people are working on. it was chaos, and the board we had was never updated
      
    

3. Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of using, or not using, Scrum to organise your project. 
    

  

  

# 03 Extreme Programming (XP)

  

1. Briefly describe the philosophy of XP and its main purpose.
    To take the good things in software development, and crank it to 111.
	
  

2. Reflect on how you have applied XP values, principles or practices in your semester project.
   A bit of pair programming was done. We are all very courageous.
   Incremental design has been done.
    

- If you have not, reflect on how you could have applied it.
  We could have communicated, maybe with Kanban.
    

  

3. Discuss the main differences between XP and Scrum, and how they can be utilized together.
   Scrum is a loose framework, XP is a set of concrete tools specifically for software development. XP tells you what to do and how. XP can be applied on top of scrum.

- Feel free to include examples from your project, if you have done so.  
      
    

  

  

  

# 05 Product Management, Story Mapping and Product Roadmap

1. Have you used user stories in your project, why or why not?
   No. We were disorganised. User experience is not a goal, it is research oriented.
    
2. Have you used personas in your project, why or why not?
   No, see 05.1.
    

# 06 Risk Management

1. Did you apply any risk management activities in your project, and if so, did it help you avoid consequences that you have encountered before in earlier projects?
   We used git to prevent code loss, and ensure we could reverse problematic developments.
   This constitutes risk mitigation, based on a risk assessment.
   We also performed assessment and mitigation with regards to data security concerns.
   
    
    1. If you did not apply any risk management, have you encountered any problems that might have been avoided if you did?
        

# 07 Quality Management

1. Have you employed any quality management in your project and if so, how has it helped you in this project compared to previous projects?
   Process:
   We have some files that contains experiment results. This can be process quality, as the goal is to gather data and analyse it.
   
    
2. Do you think that your project has an acceptable quality? why and why not?
   Yes, i think we will get a passing grade.
   We have the flexibility attribute, allegedly.
   Some testability, in that the model is tested constantly. 
    

  

  

# 08 Agile Testing

  

1. Software Testing serves the purpose of “..showing that a program does what it is intended to do and to discover program defects before it is put to use..”  
      
    Why do we do this? Have we throughout the course been presented with compelling evidence indicating that finding defects in testing is preferable to some alternative?
    
    We test to ensure either validation or verification.
    The earlier an error is caught, the cheaper it is to fix.
    

  

2. What might be a method to validate (confirming that the product is fit for use) a product early in the development cycle?  
    Prototyping. User testing increments.
    
3. There are three states of testing, development testing, release testing and user testing. Under release testing, requirement testing is specified. Do we have a method for iteratively doing release testing?
    DevOps, CiCD

  

4. Somerville states that release testing and system testing (a subcategory of Development testing) are distinct. How so?
    Release testing should be done by a separate team.
    System testing is verification, release is ~validation.

  

# 09 Dual Track Agile

  

1. In your own words, what is Dual Track Agile?
    Dual track is when the team is continually doing discovery along with development, and the team should include people with discovery competences.

  

2. According to Jeff Patton, there is one main misconception of Dual Track Agile, what is it, and how might it manifest itself if carried out?
   That it is duel track, not dual. That the tracks are separate, or multiple teams.
    

  

3. Allegedly according to sources, Kanban and Scrum can be summarized in fewer than 100 words. In your very own words, how might one combine a central concept of Scrum with the purpose of Kanban, to avoid having too many post-it notes clump up a singular column?
   Limit the amount of ongoing tasks based on team size. Aim for half as many tasks as there are team members ish.
    

  

# 10 Configuration Management DevOps

  

1. Configuration Management is centered around four main activities which are.
    

1. Change management
   We dont have any organised, also dont really have a customer.
2. Version management
   Git, maybe dont bother with lines.
4. System building
   We use uv to handle dependencies.
   We have no build system, the end product is not a piece of executeable software.

6. Release management
   Not applicable for our project.
  

How have these been applied throughout your project? Have there been frustrations regarding standards and how changes are made? How might these potential

  

2. DevOps is the combination of development and operations with the goal of streamlining development, maintenance, and integration into production. How does DevOps achieve all of these goals?
   By automating the steps, to minimise the amount of time needed, therefore freeing resources for further development, while making it easier.
