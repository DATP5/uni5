| Samsung bluetooth chip testing | A less manual work-intensive way to consistently measure the power use under various events across time, which in our case is reduced to identifying the windows in which certain (sub)events happen | An AI to classify (sub)events in the timeseries data, which works across multiple chips | Given that we do this as a student project, our main goal is to become better at developing AI, and not to improve some external situation. Though we do hope to help samsung with their needs, as part of that |
